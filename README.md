# 🎄 Advent of Code - Hayden's Solutions 🌟

Welcome to my festive coding journey through the **Advent of Code**! This repository is where I'll be unwrapping my solutions to the daily puzzles. Imagine a digital advent calendar, but instead of chocolate, you get a satisfying dose of coding puzzles. 🍫 -> 💻

## What's Advent of Code?

Advent of Code is an annual December event where programmers of all skill levels are gifted with daily coding challenges. Think of it as your brain's gym membership, but with holiday cheer and a lot of head-scratching. 🤔🎅

## 🚀 Getting Started

Want to dive into the puzzles? Here's how to get started:

1. **Visit [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)** - Prepare yourself for an epic journey through code and holiday spirit.
2. **Clone This Repository**: `git clone [Your-Repo-URL]`
3. **Navigate into the directory**: `cd [Your-Repo-Name]`
4. **Run the code** for each day: `python day_[number].py` - replace `python day_[number]` with the appropriate command and file name. I may use different languages like JavaScript or TypeScript to enhance my understanding.

## 📂 Repository Structure

- Each day's puzzle is neatly wrapped in its own directory, labeled from `day_01` to `day_25`.
- Inside each day's folder, you'll find:
  - The puzzle description: `README.md`
  - My solution: `solution.py`
  - Input data: `input.txt`
  - And sometimes, a sprinkle of additional files if needed.

## 🎯 My Goals

This year, I'm decking the halls with the following goals:

- Sharpen my coding skills, one puzzle at a time.
- Keep solutions as efficient and clean as Santa's workshop.
- Inject a bit of humor and creativity into my code comments.
- Finish all 25 days before the New Year's ball drops. 🕛

## 🤖 Technologies Used

This year, I'm solving puzzles using:

- Python 🐍 - Because who doesn't love a language named after a British comedy troupe?
- A hefty dose of holiday cheer and hot cocoa ☕🎄
